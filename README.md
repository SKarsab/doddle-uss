## Features
- ### Built for Unity but Familiar to Web Devs
Doddle USS is built specifically for Unity with all the loved standards and lessons from popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. This makes getting started with Doddle USS easy for contributors from all aspects of development.
- ### Highly Configurable
Configure th utility class library to your specific needs. Control individual properties of specific UI such as border color, or the look and feel of the entire library like default border radius all at once by changing only a few variables.
- ### Built in Theme Support
Effortlessly support light mode, dark mode, or holiday theme updates by simply overriding Doddle's default theme and customizing the theme content
- ### Utility Classes
Doddle USS contains utility classes for every UI Toolkit property all in one style sheet allowing you to build your UI without an ever-growing list of custom classes.
- ### Extension Methods & Transition Library
Doddle USS isn't just a collection of utility classes, but a full library of extension methods, entry/exit/hover/loop transitions, and templates that can be used to build your UI, and add fucntionality.
- ### Custom Controls
Take advantage of custom controls like box shadows, gradients, toggles, and more that are missing from Unity's UI Toolkit.
